**0x.tools** is a set of open-source utilities for analyzing application performance on Linux. It has a goal of deployment simplicity and minimal dependencies, to reduce friction of systematic troubleshooting. There’s no need to upgrade the OS, install kernel modules, heavy monitoring frameworks, Java agents or databases. These tools also work on over-decade-old Linux kernels, like version 2.6.18 from 14 years ago.

**0x.tools** allow you to measure individual thread level activity, like thread sleep states, currently executing system calls and kernel wait locations. Additionally, you can drill down into CPU usage of any thread or the system as a whole. You can be systematic in your troubleshooting - no need for guessing or clever metric-voodoo tricks with traditional system-level statistics.
